# Project 1 - Factors That Affect Credit Payment

## Introduction

As we looked for interesting datasets in our research for this project, we came across the dataset found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-card-approval and we thought, what factors can affect credit card payments? This can be useful for companies that issue credit cards to see if a certain person with certain attributes would be able to pay their credit cards on time and make decisions 

In this project, we examined the relationship between Credit Status, which indicated how timely a person is able to pay their loans on their credit card, and various factors such as Age, Gender, Car and House Ownership, Having Children, Length of Employment, Income and Job Type. The dataset found on Final_output.zip has more than 500000 rows so we took random rows from this dataset and compiled it on sample_dataset.csv, which has 50000 rows.

The work that we did can be useful for companies that issue credit cards to see if a certain person with certain attributes would be able to pay their credit cards on time and make decisions based on our work.

## Analysis
We analysed the dataset by grouping credit status with each factors. Following this, we conducted chi square test to statistically measure the significance of the relationship between the factors and credit status.
